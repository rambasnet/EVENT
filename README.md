This project is part of my independent study for MS degree at New Mexico Tech

Consolidates network vulnerability assessment reports from industry best scanners and generates prioritized custom reports for all levels of IT staff. Provides a unified GUI framework for popular network security scanners (Nmap, Amap, and Nessus Client). 

These scripts are part of a GUI framework that also contained module to automate vulnerability exploitation.
